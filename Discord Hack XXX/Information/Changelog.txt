1.7 [STABLE] - 2019:
A major change to the token grabber has been made: it now gets sent by a discord webhook.
The preview available when making a theme has been improved on heavily, to make it look more like the casual DiscordHaxx UI.
An option to add tokens not from a list, but just from text has been added.
The "recover" button has been removed from the "Tokens" tab.
Heavy optimizations towards DiscordHaxx Shield, to make it faster, and so therefor attacks can be started off much quicker.
The settings now use JSON, which is gonna make them a lot more stable.
Small changes to the directories.
Other minor UI changes.

1.7(.1) [BETA] - 2019:
The token grabber now no longer shows a console, but instead just runs completely in the background.
The token puller has been made easier to use, because it now shows a dialog at the start where the user can choose a path to the database file.
Small optimizations towards the attacks.

1.7 [BETA] - 2019:
Proxy support is now here, meaning that you can use proxies for the different attacks.
The token grabbing feature has been added.
You can now log into tokens, and view their information.
Partitions are now removed, because of them basically being useless.
Multiple bug fixes
Minor UI changes.
More coming in the stable/official release :).
